# Automatic-UAV-Flight

This repository contains two python programs for automatic UAV flight on specific and well-designed route.
## Aruco-Chasing
This one emphasizes tracking ArUco markers, with default detectors in opencv library.
## Obstacle Avoiding
This one integrates an image classification network to recognize different image categories (e.g., giraffes, elephants, etc.) and perform specific flight maneuvers based on the detected classes, enabling the system to avoid obstacles along its path.
