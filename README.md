# Automatic-UAV-Flight

This repository contains two python programs for automatic UAV flight on specific and well-designed route.

One program emphasizes tracking ArUco markers, while the other integrates an image classification network to identify various image categories (such as giraffes, elephants, etc.) and execute corresponding flight maneuvers based on detected classes.
